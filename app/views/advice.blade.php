						If you're afraid of not being challenged enough at whatever college it is you're going to then I would say you need to reevaluate how you look at college. College is about YOU and what YOU make of it. Expecting everything to come to you and challenge you is an assumption that can be unhealthy. Even at an Ivy League you can sit back in your dorm room, or slack, or party, or whatever it is. How challenging the environment is depends totally on how you approach college. If you challenge YOURSELF, and find opportunities and get yourself out there, then you will draw in other people who also want to be challenged and who also want to work hard. It isn't about people coming to you and telling you how things work anymore, it's about you getting out into the world and living the way you want to.

						If you're worried about finding new friends at college, that's a completely understandable fear. You're leaving the Uni bubble completely for the first time and that can be scary. What I will tell you is this--do the things you love and people will follow. If you like to party then you will find friends who also party, if you like to exercise you'll find friends at the gym, if you like harry potter you'll find friends who like harry potter. Join clubs that fit your interests, and pursue your passions and friends will fall into place and it will be amazing. This, though, requires GETTING OUT THERE. Get out there on campus and experience college life! Don't sit in your room all day, and don't sit alone for meals in the dining halls. Smile at the people that you walk past and don't hide your face or try to look away. Keep your head up, do the things you love, and soon you'll find people who will be amazingly supportive friends.
